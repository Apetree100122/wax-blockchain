The challenge here revolves around CPU being a subjective resource, which means that its calculation varies from node to node. This can introduce discrepancies in fee calculations, as the cost basis (CPU) is not consistent. The proposition is to continue using the CPU as a basis for fee calculations (given that it well captures the transaction's cost to run on a node) but find a way to make it non-subjective.

This solution suggests using a "virtual fee" based on the subjective CPU and then transitioning the fee to be based on "Net consumed" and "number of actions" in the transaction. The idea is to desubjectify in a similar fashion to staking currently does by having the fees be actually charged at an objective rate after say, 24 hours. Therefore, this approach can be seen as a two-phase fee calculation:

Virtual Fee Calculation (Immediate Post-Transaction)

  This is a preliminary fee based on the CPU consumption. It serves as an immediate indication of the cost but might not be the final fee to be deducted.

  Formula:
    Virtual Fee = CPU Fee Scaler × (1 / (Max Block CPU - EMA Block CPU) - 1 / (Max Block CPU)) × Tx CPU Consumption

Actual Fee Calculation (Cool Down Period - 24 hours???)

  * Over time, the virtual fee cools down (or adjusts) based on the actual resources utilized by the transaction, specifically "Net consumed" and "number of actions".
  * Formula:
    Actual Fee = α × Net Consumed + β × Number of Actions + gamma
    where α, β, and gamma are constants to be determined based on network dynamics, market conditions, and desired economic incentives.

Analysis of this Approach:

  * Predictability: Introducing a virtual fee based on CPU followed by a cool down adjustment allows users to get an immediate estimation of the cost and later be adjusted to a more 'fair' value based on actual resources used.

  * Flexibility: The model is dynamic. It's sensitive to real-time network congestion (via CPU usage) but adjusts to concrete metrics (Net consumed and number of actions), preventing wild fluctuations due to the subjective nature of CPU calculations across nodes.

  * Fairness: Transactions that genuinely consume more resources will end up paying more. The number of actions provides an additional layer of granularity to the pricing, ensuring that even complex transactions with multiple actions (but perhaps low net or CPU consumption) don't get off lightly.

  * Network Health: The two-phase fee model might encourage better transaction optimization. If users see that actions and net consumption heavily influence their final fee, they might optimize their transactions to be more efficient.

  * Complexity: One downside could be the perceived complexity. Users will have to understand two distinct fee calculation phases, which might not be intuitive for everyone.

  * Potential for Gaming: Like all economic models, there's a potential for sophisticated actors to find and exploit inefficiencies. For example, by stuffing a transaction with many low-cost actions to minimize the CPU-based virtual fee, knowing that the final adjustment might be in their favour.

  Implementation: Nodes will need mechanisms to adjust fees after the fact, which could introduce complexity into transaction settlement and accounting.

In conclusion, while the proposed two-phase fee model has potential advantages, it will be crucial to model, test, and simulate this approach rigorously before full-scale implementation. We'd also need to monitor and adjust α and β values over time based on real-world data to ensure the fee system remains fair, efficient, and beneficial to the network's health.
